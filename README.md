# Freeway-Frenzy
 Vehicle shooter prototype game

## ABSTRACT
Develop an endless runner based on single player in 2D shooting objects as they approach them; aesthetic of an endless race over a freeway set in 1980â€™s 8bit style. 

## GAME OBJECTIVE
Player spawns in on road with a few lanes, all presented with barriers, obstacles, enemies or power ups until the level objective is met such as rescuing passengers, making it past a certain amount of exits, defeating a boss, or winning a race.

### BRANCHING
Right now each branch will represent a new feature/function in the game, we will merge a branch will many features to create a full build (alpha, beta, etc.); right now trying to develop good project habits. 

## CURRENT BUILD FEATURES 
Sprite for car, menu present, first level laid out. 

## CURRENT BUILD ISSUES
Level 1 road is not laid correctly, will not infinitely spawn vertically; vehicle is not locked to road; score and HUD not visible even though present; Menu UI will not disappear, buttons to UI do not work.
